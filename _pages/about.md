Welcome to my website :wave: I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I'm a comparativist with a regional focus on mainland Southeast Asia, and Vietnam in particular. I study authoritarianism, state-building, ethnic politics, and the political economy of development. My dissertation, "The Dictator's Gambit: Causes and Consequences of Territorial Autonomy Arangements in Authoritarian Regimes", documents the rise and consequences of ethnic autonomy arangements in 20th century as part of the modern autocratic state-building process. My dissertation committee members are: [Mark R. Beissinger](https://mbeissinger.scholar.princeton.edu), [Atul Kohli](https://kohli.scholar.princeton.edu), and [Rory Truex](https://www.rorytruex.com).

In addition to my main research agenda, I am also interested in the politics, economics, and legal issues of higher education. I consider myself a service oriented academic with a strong interest in higher education administration and student success. I currently sit on the Board of Trustees at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu) and serve as a [Graduate Financial Wellness Fellow](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/understand-your-finances/financial-wellness-fellows-program).

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I completed my bachelors degree with honors at Carleton College where I majored in Political Science/International Relations and a minor in Political Economy. I have also held research positions at [The World Bank (Development Finance unit)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/dfi), [Yale University Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.yale.edu), and [Michigan State University Department of Political Science](https://polisci.msu.edu).

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy traveling, making music, and playing (and watching) tennis :tennis:

Thanks for stopping by!
